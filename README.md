# Waste-classification-using-Deep-Learning
This project aims to classify images of waste into different categories (e.g. organic, recyclable) using transfer learning with a pre-trained CNN model (ResNet18) implemented in PyTorch.
## 📌 Project Overview

- **Framework**: PyTorch
- **Model**: Transfer learning with `resnet18`
- **Dataset**: Custom image dataset (manually labeled)
- **Accuracy**: ~94% on validation set
- **Purpose**: Assist in automated recycling and waste management processes

## 🧠 Workflow

1. Load and preprocess the image data
2. Apply data augmentation and normalization
3. Use transfer learning to fine-tune a ResNet model
4. Evaluate model accuracy and performance
